# Traps Interrupts and Faults

Often treated as the same
- what they do is the same
- when they do it is different
- all triggered by events

Subroutine calls in assembly
1. Program counter gets stored somewhere
- points to next instruction
2. Fetch cycle
- fetch execute cycle
- pulls in bit pattern from memory
- increments program counter
3. Branch instruction sets program counter 

Subroutine saves current subroutine call 

1. Triggered by an event
2. Vectored call

Traditional subroutine call goes to a hardcoded address
Vectored subroutine call goes to a table in memory and goes to an address (which is hard coded)

FOR READING ABOUT INTERRUPTS LOOK UP SMI -> SMRAM 

## Faults
Common Faults
- divide by 0
- accessing memory you aren't allowed to access
- 

A Fault 
- runs a fault handler -> exact same as subroutine
- 

## Traps
A trap is a user triggered event
trap is like a subroutine 
Often asking the kernel for certain types of help

1 table, multiple tables? Who defined the ISA

1 hard coded section of memory

All interrupts and all faults, and all traps should return, if they don't you have a bad OS programmer

Hardcoded behavior -> boot loaders
- [SEC initialization code]
- boot loader?

Any code can do a trap request

## CPU Privilege Mode
[This is TPL in tianocore edk2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/7d055812cc7a7d2b062cf56291211e8cecca36ed/MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Event/Tpl.c#L95)

Minimum - two levels
- level for shlubs who can do what owner defines
- level for owner who can do anything

[x86 has a lot more](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*mKsH4qcTSzFYvVyxskZewg.jpeg)

How do we switch between these modes?
How does the kernel ever reescalate?

KEY Concept: Traps and Interrupts evelate privilige and transfer contro to the subroutine as one atomic step that cannot be interrupted at the assembly code level

Traps are intentional

Trap interrupt and faults transfer control away from the process
