# What is a Process?

Kernel Space (1gb)
- contains process table with pids

Random Stack Offset
- for security
Stack (grows down)
- size of RLIMIT_STACK
Random  mmap offset
- for security
Memory mapping Segment
- file mappings
- dynamic libraries
- anonymous mappings
Random Brk offset
BSS Segment
- uninitialized static vriables, filled with zeros
Data Segment
- static variables initialized by the programmer
- text segement (ELF)


Processes are spin ups of programs
- 2 processes can have the same program and be entirely different
- share nothing, not even const static variables

Classic Model 
- running in parallel
- kernel keeping illusion that they are seperate
Other model
- sometimes the processes talk
- sometimes they postcard, share memory, etc
    - firefox is an example, spins up helper processes
